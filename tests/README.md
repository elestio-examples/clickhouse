## Docker-compose

Here are some example snippets to help you get started creating a container.

        version: "3.3"
        services:

        clickhouse:
            image: elestio4test/clickhouse-server:${SOFTWARE_VERSION_TAG}
            restart: unless-stopped
            volumes:
            - ./data:/var/lib/clickhouse
            - ./config/clickhouse-user-config.xml:/etc/clickhouse-server/users.d/logging.xml:ro

                soft: 262144
                hard: 262144

        tabix:
                image: spoonest/clickhouse-tabix-web-client
                ports:
                    - 172.17.0.1:28124:80
                depends_on:
                    - clickhouse
                restart: unless-stopped
                environment:
                    - CH_NAME=clickhouse
                    - CH_HOST=https://${DOMAIN}:18123

                    - CH_PASSWORD=${SOFTWARE_PASSWORD}



### Environment variables

|         Variable           |      Value (example)       |
| :------------------------: | :------------------------: |
|    SOFTWARE_VERSION_TAG    |         latest             |
|    HOST_DOMAIN             |         DOMAIN             |

# Maintenance

## Logging

The Elestio Clickhouse Docker image sends the container logs to stdout. To view the logs, you can use the following command:

    docker-compose logs -f

To stop the stack you can use the following command:

    docker-compose down

## Backup and Restore with Docker Compose

To make backup and restore operations easier, we are using folder volume mounts. You can simply stop your stack with docker-compose down, then backup all the files and subfolders in the folder near the docker-compose.yml file.

Creating a ZIP Archive
For example, if you want to create a ZIP archive, navigate to the folder where you have your docker-compose.yml file and use this command:

    zip -r myarchive.zip .

Restoring from ZIP Archive
To restore from a ZIP archive, unzip the archive into the original folder using the following command:

    unzip myarchive.zip -d /path/to/original/folder

Starting Your Stack
Once your backup is complete, you can start your stack again with the following command:

    docker-compose up -d

That's it! With these simple steps, you can easily backup and restore your data volumes using Docker Compose.
